# Netflix Content Analysis Project

## Abstract
This project, titled *"Analyzing Netflix: Insights from Streaming Data"*, is a collaborative initiative aimed at uncovering trends in Netflix content and predicting viewer engagement. The analysis was conducted using the R programming language, employing several R libraries such as dplyr and stringr for data processing. The goal was to understand patterns in viewer preferences, identify popular genres, and analyze trends across different regions and time periods.

*Guide*: Dr. Panchatcharam M.

## Project Objectives
- *Trend Analysis*: Uncover genre trends in Netflix content across different regions and time periods.
- *Viewer Engagement Prediction*: Use data to predict viewer engagement based on content type, region, and release periods.
- *Data Processing*: Employ R libraries to clean, manipulate, and analyze data effectively.

## Tools & Technologies
- *R*: Primary language used for data analysis.
- *RStudio*: IDE used for development.
- *Libraries*:
  - dplyr: For data manipulation and wrangling.
  - stringr: For string processing and manipulation.

## Features
1. *Genre Trend Analysis*: Analyze genre trends in different regions and across various time periods.
2. *Viewer Preferences*: Identify which genres are most preferred by viewers in different regions.
3. *Engagement Prediction*: Utilize models to predict future viewer engagement based on past data.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. *Install R*: If you haven't already installed R, you can download it from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
2. *Install RStudio*: Download RStudio from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
3. *Clone this repository*: Run the following command in your terminal:
    bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/netflix-content-analysis.git
    
4. *Install required packages*: Open the project in RStudio and install the required libraries by running:
    r
    install.packages(c("dplyr", "stringr"))
    

## Usage

1. *Data Import*: Make sure your dataset is available in the data/ folder of the project.
2. *Running the analysis*: The main script for analysis is netflix_analysis.R. You can run this file in RStudio by clicking the "Run" button.
3. *Output*: The results of the genre trend analysis and viewer predictions will be saved in the output/ folder as CSV files or visualizations.

## Data
- The dataset contains Netflix content details such as genre, region, release date, and viewer metrics.

## Results
- This project provides insight into the most popular genres and predicts viewer engagement trends over time.
